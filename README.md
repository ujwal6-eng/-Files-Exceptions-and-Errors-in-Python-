ASSIGNMENT 4

Module 5: Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python
 
Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors 
Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that:
1.   Opens and reads a text file named sample.txt.
2.   Prints its content line by line.
3.   Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.
 
Expected Output:

If the file exists:
Reading file content:
Line 1 : This is a sample text file.
Line 2 : It contains multiple lines.

if the file does not exist:
Error: The File 'sample.txt' was not found.

Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
 
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt.
2.   Appends additional data to the same file.
3.   Reads and displays the final content of the file.
 

Expected Output:
 For example, if the user enters 25, the output should be:
Enter text to write to the file: Hello, Python!

Data successfully written to output.txt.

Enter additional text to append: Learning file handling in Python.

Data successfully appended.

Final content of output.txt: Hello Python!
Learning file handling in python.
